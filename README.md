# Plushie Passport Contact Page

Hello! 👋  
If you've found this page, it's likely you have found one of my travel companions that I have unfortunately lost. 

This page exists so that if one of my companions ever gets separated from me while traveling, kind people like you can help them come home and rejoin their friends. 

こんにちは！👋
このページをご覧いただいているということは、私の旅の仲間であるぬいぐるみを見つけてくださったのかもしれません。

このページは、旅先などで私とぬいぐるみが離れてしまった時に、
親切な方が見つけてくださった際、おうちに帰れるように作成したものです。

このあとに日本語でのご案内も続きます。
一部翻訳による表現の違いなどがあるかもしれませんが、どうかご容赦くださいませ。
